This species occurs throughout southeastern Australia.",

      "description": "The endangered Alpine Stonefly is found only on the Bogong High Plains in Victoria and is known from only 12 sites within this region. Nymphs are usually found in narrow, stony streams, while adults live in nearby rocks and vegetation. The species is long-lived, spending approximately three years developing to the adult stage. Adults emerge between February and May each year, and live for only two months. The largest of Australia's stoneflies, the nymphs are also the top insect predators in streams and eat a variety of both plant and animal material.",

Adults are hairy, drab, and rather disheveled in appearance; in many species, adult females are soft-bodied and completely wingless. The alpine case moth is one of two species (the other being the alpine swift moth/grass grub) often blamed for large-scale damage to snowgrass (<i>Poa</i> spp.).",
